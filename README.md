# eICU - Predicting Patient Outcomes
Hospitals face challenges in bed management, staff allocation, insurance costs, decision support, and early warning for critical patients. Our project uses AI model on EHR data to predict patient outcomes by learning from similar past patients. This helps doctors decide treatments faster, improves resource management, and reduces healthcare costs.
